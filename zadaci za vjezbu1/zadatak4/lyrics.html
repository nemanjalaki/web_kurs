    <i><pre>
        I got this pretty thang from the west side
Face tatted like I grew up on the east
She ain't foreign but my baby get the best ride
Ooh, she a muhfuckin' beast
And she say I don't pay her attention
I said, "Baby, I'm chasin' these millions"
Scratch my back and say, "Baby, I feel you"
I told her, "Stay down and stay patient, let's get it"

I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
Girl, I'm not finna play with your time
Them lil' niggas just wasting your time
And I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?

Yeah, I can never ever ever ever ever trust another woman
And she can never ever ever ever ever ever trust another nigga
And she know all them funny niggas that she fucking with ain't fucking with me
And any time that it's on your mind, baby, you can come and get it
I be rather waiting, it's not what that other bitch
One of the other ones I say I wasn't fucking with
I'll drop you off and come pick up another bitch
I'll drop it off in her drawers and she loving it
Do what I do, but I swear I don't love a bitch
Don't have the patience, no I cannot take it
I just want the face, yo, I don't want relations
I want you to save it, I know you insane, yeah
She say that she with it, now girl, don't you lie to me
You need to quit it, now girl, don't you lie to me
She know I'm that nigga, I look like the lottery
Don't play with my pistol, you gon' get shit up out of me

    <i><pre>
        Another two months on the road
        Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
        Where things move a little slower
        And people always wave goodbye and say hello
        And the maples on this road they must be three hundred years old
        Just imagine all the stories they could tell
        Of the tractors and the cars
        All comin' home from Liston's bar
        And the country folk just out to raise some hell
        To raise some hell
        
        This is my home
        This is where I belong
        Where my daughters go to school
        Where opinions are strong
        Where my neighbors are my friends
        And the story never ends
        
        So I just hit the ground and keep on runnin'
        All of yesterday has come and gone
        And so you try to pick up all the pieces
        Put it all back the way that it belongs
        Well the next thing that you know
        It's time to play another show
        I'm leavin' out of here just after dawn
        Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
        That this town has got your back when you are gone
        When you are gone
        
        And this is my home
        This is where I belong
        Where my daughters go to school
        Where opinions are strong
        And my amendment rights
        They keep me safe at night
        Where my neighbors are my friends
        And the story never ends
        
        This is my home

    <h1 id="song3">Hemiplegia</h1>

    <i><pre>
        Slow, slow, slow
Wade through water
Numbed the lightness
Words don't bother

I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving?
Hemiplegia holds me tight

Gold, gold, gold
Burns our ocean
Forced I sold
My devotion

I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving?
Hemiplegia holds me tight

No you can't move up with your eyes down
No you can't look up with your eyes down
No you can't move up with your eyes down
No you can't move up with your eyes down

No you can't move up with your eyes down
No you can't move up with your eyes down
No you can't move up with your eyes down
No you can't move up

I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving?
Hemiplegia holds me tight
I cannot fight the sleep is droning

    <i><pre>
        I know you love her, love her
But deep down under the covers, covers
Does she know that I am the other, other
Does she?

Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always like it so frantic, frantic
Listen to me
Just love me, love me, love me, love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dawn
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Trying to get into my head
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Play it over and over again

No I won't blow your cover, cover
I know it's not your fault that you love her, love her
And I'm betting that you will discover
I'm not someone you can try to keep

Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always like it so frantic, frantic
Listen to me
Just love me, love me, love me, love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dawn
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

    <h1 id="song5">Chiave</h1>

    <i><pre>
        Per le volte che ho perso
Sfidarsi allo specchio
Per le cose di un tempo
Che mi tagliano dentro
Per tutti i ricordi
Tra quelli che scordi
Le notti in un parco tra amici e discorsi
Per quando ho sbagliato
Talento sprecato
Su un banco di scuola, io, perplesso e incazzato
Per lei che mi amava
I suoi occhi pianeti
In cui entri per sbaglio ed esci in punta di piedi
Per le frasi mai dette
Chi corre e poi smette
Per chi parla d'eroi e dopo un passo s'arrende
Fottuti i miei pianti, i miei occhi più stanchi
Per chi chiede un sorriso e ha mille rimpianti
Per le mie promesse da sempre le stesse
Vado a vincere e torno, mamy dimmi ci riesci
Per mio padre che aspetta che io sia più tranquillo
Nonostante i tuoi sbagli, sei tra gli esempi più grandi

Per i momenti di semplicità
Per chi rimane e per chi se ne va
Per le volte che cammino in questa strada e non so dove mi porterà
E per chi aspetta una vita diversa
Per me che avevo una stella e l'ho persa
Per chi si vanta di esser forte io che invece incido un'altra debolezza
Un'altra debolezza
Un'altra debolezza

Per chi ha visto fallire progetti importanti
Chi rifugia nei grammi i suoi tagli più grandi
Per le mie tante parti che mi rendono instabile
Un dolore abitabile che riempe le pagine
Per i figli di troia che non mi hanno compreso
Per chi sogna soltanto chi si sente un peso
Per chi parte da solo ma poi torna cambiato
Per chi invece sta fermo e da un pezzo ha mollato
Per la barca che vola se non trova il suo mare
Per l'incendio che brucia tutto ciò che rimane
Per la pioggia che bagna le mie ansie di notte
Per chi ha chiesto di esistere ma nessuno risponde
Per le volte che ho urlato: "io mi sento diverso"
E non riesco a capire qui dove sia il senso
Se nasci solo, vivi solo, muori solo
Sono pessimista quanto basta per sentirmi solo
Per chi non si innnamora perche odia star bene
Per chi invece ama tutti perche il vuoto lo teme
Per il panico infame per la nota sospesa
Per chi è ultimo e vale per la chiave che ho appesa

Per i momenti di semplicità
Per chi rimane e per chi se ne va
Per le volte che cammino in questa strada e non so dove mi porterà
E per chi aspetta una vita diversa
Per me che avevo una stella e l'ho persa
Per chi si vanta di esser forte io che invece incido un'altra debolezza
